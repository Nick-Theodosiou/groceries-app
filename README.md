# Groceries App

This is the first app I built using Android studio in 2021. It's a groceries app where you can find products listed by different supermarkets and add them to your cart. 
Then you're able to compare the prices of the items in your cart with other supermarkets, helping you find the cheapest one for your chosen groceries.

The app is linked to Google Firebase and I have only uploaded test information for the first two supermarkets (Alphamega and Lidl), also the list saving option has not been implemented yet.

This is a [link](https://appetize.io/app/5nxsgofmywlzgobthdc42qxmoa) to it if you want to try the app out in your browser, or for a better experience directly download the [apk](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Am66JJ4KM2PUhAo5mkfDjtqPmDUn?e=Xe1PnA). (only the first two stores have dummy information uploaded on the database for demonstration purposes)
